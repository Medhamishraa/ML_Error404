Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions
Financial institutions face challenges in detecting and preventing fraudulent transactions, which can result in significant financial losses. Develop a machine learning model that analyzes transaction patterns and user behaviors to detect and flag potentially fraudulent activities in real-time. Through this machine learning model, we aim to enhance the security of financial transactions through credit cards by providing an advanced fraud detection system that identifies suspicious activities, quickly and accurately.â€‹
